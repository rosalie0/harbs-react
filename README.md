## Diagrams & Planning

With how important design is for a landing page, we made a basic sketch of the page's flow before creating any of its pieces.

## About

_Rose:_

> Coming out of bootcamp, I wanted to use my skills to solve real-world problems.
>
> So, I decided to look around me.
>
> As someone who works at HARBS, I found our official website a bit lacking.
> Eager to practice my front end and UX/UI skills, I tasked myself with creating a modern, clean landing page.
>
> I missed the social aspect of pair-programming & also wanted insights on designs. So I invited one of my cohort-mates onto the project.
